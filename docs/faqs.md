  <summary> Why am I getting an error that the server is taking too long when loading dashboard? </summary>

  Apparent delays downloading from Dashboard's server can be caused by many things, but are often the result of antivirus software or a firewall used by your organization.  After checking with your own IT administrators, if you are still unable to download the dashboard, please ask the Dashboard Desk for assistance.
