# Setup Alert

---

With `Alert Me`, you can define alerts to track progress on specific indicators. You can create more than one alert for a single metric and share it with other users of the application.
1. To set up an alert, navigate the dashboard and click the `Gear` on your chosen indicator. A drop-down menu appears.
2. From the menu, click `Alert Me`, a popover window will open.
3. From the window, click on the `Disclosure drop-down arrow` and you'll see a list of parameters you wish to connect. Fill in all required fields indicated by a red asterisk to the left of the field label.
4. Once you're done, click `Next`.
5. Compose a notification message, and then click `Next`.
6. You can share the alert with other users. Input their email addresses in the blank field.
7. Click `Done`.
