With `Alert Me`, you can define alerts to track progress on specific indicators. You can create more than one alert for a single metric and share it with other users of the application.
1. To set up an alert, navigate the dashboard and click the `Gear` on your chosen indicator, then choose `Alert Me`.
2. Click the `Disclosure drop-down arrow` and you'll see a list of parameters you wish to connect. Fill in all required fields indicated by a red asterisk to the left of the field label.
3. Once you're done, click `Next`.
4. Compose a notification message, and then click `Next`.
5. You can share the alert with other users. Input their email addresses in the blank field.
6. Click `Done`.
