* _Filter Columns_. Click on the pull-down arrow for the column you want to filter. A pop-up box appears. Check the boxes next to the data you want to filter.

* _Send/export_. The arrow allows you to  export or send the current data in the table in CSV or Excel format.

* _Schedule as Report_. You can set up a report to run itself daily, weekly or monthly and send the results automatically to the people who need to see them, so that you donâ€™t have to remember to log in and do it yourself.
